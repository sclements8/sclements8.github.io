<h1> About Me </h1>
<h4> My name is Sam Clements and I am a sophomore here at URI. I am majoring in film/media and would be happy with any job in the film industry, 
  but would like to work as a camera operator most of all. I have been involved in camera work here at URI, shooting several athletics events 
  that have streamed on ESPN. 
  <br>
  I have been playing ice hockey ever since I was six years old, and am a big fanatic  of the hometown Bruins. I enjoy traveling, and have traveled 
  all across the country in places such as Hawaii, New York City, Washington DC and the Rocky Mountains. </h4>
